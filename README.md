# Project-car-rental


This Python program simulates a car rental service, allowing users to view available cars, rent a car for a specified number of days, and return rented cars. It utilizes dictionaries to store information about the car portfolio, rented cars, and returned cars. The program presents a menu interface for users to navigate through different options, such as viewing the car portfolio, renting a car, or returning a car. User inputs are validated to ensure proper functionality, and the program provides clear instructions and feedback messages throughout the process.
